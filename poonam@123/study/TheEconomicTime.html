<h2><i>Raghuram Rajan wants central banks to focus only on inflation control to do an effective job.</i></h2><br><br>
Rising inflation globally has brought the role of <u>central banks</u> under sharp scrutiny with many experts pointing<br> to their failure in reading the exact nature of price pressures last year.
Former <b>RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan</b>, in an interview to<br> Bloomberg, said that the central banks would do a far more effective job if they focus only on controlling inflation. He said issues like climate change job creation, though peripheral <br>to the central bank mandate, can better be dealt with direct policy making.</p>
